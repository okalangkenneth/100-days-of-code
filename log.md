# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 7, 2021 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Created an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram and draw up general structure of the project.

**Thoughts:** Overall, went well with assigning attributes to the entities though it took me some time to figure out the entities.
